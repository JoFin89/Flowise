# Team Management Example

This folder contains a minimal team management app built with Node.js and Express. It demonstrates how to manage members, tasks and meetings from a simple web interface.

## Setup

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to access the app.

All data is kept in memory, so it resets when the server restarts.
